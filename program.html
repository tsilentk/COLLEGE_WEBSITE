        <h2>Vision Tech</h2>
        <p>A festival of knowledge and culture is held in the months of February and March of every year. It links different knowledge networks and reinforces the significance of Innovation, Interaction, Information, Communication and Technology in the 21st century by means of panel discussions, lectures, workshops, exhibitions and exciting competitive events. It serves as a meeting place for creative minds to discuss their ideas and allow for testing of their ideas in the face of intense competition, rigorous evaluation, culminating in sporting events and a show of talent in cultural activities.

            “VisionTech” is designed to inspire solutions in which technology, culture and humanitarianism co-exist. The participants attempt to inspire creativity that is essential for technological and cultural development. “VisionTech” creates a platform for technologists to harmonize their aptitude, learning and technical understanding and skills.
            
            “VisionTech 2004” was the first experiment with this idea of a composite festival, with events ranging from areas of Networks and Software to theatre and music competitions. The idea was to find a place where we would be able to map the mutual relationship between technology and culture and examine their reciprocity.</p>
